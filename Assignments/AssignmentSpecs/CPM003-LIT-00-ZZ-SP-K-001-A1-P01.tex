\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment you are going to implement EVM a simple Microsoft Project Plan.  The key deliverables for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Microsoft Project Project Plan, updated with a Baseline and EVM information
	\item Screenshots of the Status Dates, placed into an MS Word document
\end{enumerate}




\section*{Scenario}

You have been provided with a Microsoft Project file for the construction of a domestic dwelling.  This file is based on the sample file provided by Microsoft.  The .mpp file contains a simple Gantt chart, resources allocations including associated costs. \\

The objective of the assignment is to create EVM data for the status dates indicated in Table \ref{tab:StatusDates}.  Details of the columns necessary are provided in Figure \ref{fig:TableData}.  You will need to add some of the columns manually.  Please note that 'Actual Cost' and 'Actual Finish' columns are necessary to edit the data generated by Microsoft Project.  You will also need to set a 'Baseline' for the EVM data to be activated.\\

As part of this assignment you are required to edit the 'Actual Cost' and 'Actual Finish' columns in order to generate variances from the planned data.  This is to provide you with experience of tracking project performance within the tool.  You are free to set the Actual Costs or Actual Finish dates as you see fit.
